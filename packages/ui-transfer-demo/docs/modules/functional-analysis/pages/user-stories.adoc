== Definitions

[width="100%",cols="<50%,<50%",options="header",]
|===
|Term |Definition
|`authenticating` |The act of proving a `person`’s identity.

|`client` |The `person`-facing application.

|`data browser` |An application which can read and write `Personal data`
from a `source`, as well as `grant access`;

|`destination` |A legacy application which consumes `personal data`.

|`downloading` |The act of digitally retrieving `personal data` from a
`source`.

|`feedback` |The output of processing `personal data` . In this demo,
the `person` will be informed about the eligibility of a subsidy.

|`grant access` |The act of modifying a `source`’s access control rules
so that a `recipient` can read a specific resource.

|`middleware` |An application which `downloads` `personal data` from a
`source` and `uploads` it to a `destination`

|`person` |A citizen who has access to one or more `sources`

|`personal data` |The data exchanged between the source and recipient.
In this demo, this will be limited to Income Data.

|`proof of consent` |The proof that a `person` consented for a
`purpose`.

|`recipient` |A Solid Pod with which `personal data` is shared.

|`source` |A Solid Pod which contains `personal data`.

|`type of data` |A Linked Data Shape which describes a type of data.

|`uploading` |The act of digitally storing `personal data` in a
`destination`.
|===

== Assumptions

* A `person` has access to one or more `sources` which already contain
`personal data`.
* A `person` has sufficient permissions on his `sources` to
`grant access` to a `recipient`.
* The `recipient` does not yet have access to the `sources`, nor are
they known by the `middleware`.
* The `destination` does not yet possess the `personal data` uploaded by
the `middleware`.
* The `destination` is relational database which support SQL-queries.
* The `source` is a Node Solid Server.

== Functional requirements

=== Granting access to personal data

[arabic]
. As a `person`, I want to choose to `grant access` either via a
`data browser` or by `authenticating`, so that I can re-use my
`personal data`.
. As a `person`, I want to know to what `type of data` I will
`grant access`, so that I can decide if I want to `grant access` to this
`type of data`.
. As a `person`, I want to know to which `recipient` I am
`granting access`, so that I can decide if I want to `grant access` to
the `recipient`.
. As a `person`, I want to choose a single `source` when
`granting access` by `authenticating`, so that I can decide to which
`source` the `recipient` `gains access`.
. As a `person`, I want to `grant access` to the `recipient` by
`authenticating` at the selected `source`, so that I can access
`personal data` in the `source` from the `client`.
. As a `person`, I want to my `data browser` to determine one or more
`sources` which contain the `type of data` requested by the `recipient`,
so that I don’t have to search for the `type of data` myself.
. As a `person`, I want to be able to `grant access` to a specific
`recipient` to one or more `sources` which contain a `type of data`, so
that I don’t have to `grant access` to each `source` individually.
. As a `person`, I want to store a `proof of consent` in the `source`
and `recipient` when sharing `personal data`, so that I can proof what
`type of data` was exchanged with which `recipient`.

=== Downloading an consuming personal data

[arabic]
. As a `person`, I want to receive `feedback` based on the
`personal data` that I shared with a `recipient`, so that I get a
benefit from sharing `personal data`.
. As a `middleware`, I want to `download` `personal data` from a
`source`, so that I can `upload` it to a `destination`.
. As a `middleware`, I want to `upload` `personal data` to a
`destination`, so that the `destination` can use the `personal data`.

== Non-functional requirements

[arabic]
. The demo environment will be described as a Docker Compose file.
. The performance of the software artefacts needs to be adequate for a
good user experience, but does not need to work at scale.
. The quality of the software artefacts needs to be adequate for testing
purposes, but does not need to be of production quality.
. The software artefacts will be built by using technologies of Digita’s
choice, and may include proprietary software development kits.
. The software artefacts will be tested on a limited set of modern web
browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox.
. The software artefacts will be designed for a single resolution.

== Out of scope

[arabic]
. Integrating any of the software artefacts with existing applications.
. Providing mock data used in the demo environment.
. Hosting an deploying the Docker images containing the software
artefacts.
. Internationalization of any of the software artefacts.
. Performing any penetration (or other specialized security-related)
tests.
. Authentication with the Vlaamse Authenticatie Service.
. Ensuring or validating the authenticity of exchanged data.
