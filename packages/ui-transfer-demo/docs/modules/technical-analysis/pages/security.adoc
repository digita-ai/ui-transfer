== Security

We distinguish three areas of security.

[arabic]
. Encryption
. Authentication
. Authorization

=== Encryption

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) for all communications
between different applications. The protocol relies on the
industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for for
end-to-end encryption between sender and receiver.

=== Authentication

A Person can request a digital token from an identity provider, which
serves as proof of his identity. The token can be used when interacting
with other applications. This way, the other application will have
certainty about the Personâ€™s identity.

=== Authorization

Solid Pods, such as the `source` and `recipient`, implement the Web
Access Control (WAC) specification. This allows Pods to determine who
can read, append, update or control specific pieces of data.
