=== Introduction

==== Overview

This specification describes the landing page of the DAPSI project. This
is the first page a user sees in the overall flow.

This page does not feature much content, so it will be relatively simple
to complete.

==== Assumptions

All necessary packages are installed and ready to be used.

=== Solution

==== Suggested or proposed solution

===== Components

Generate all components under the app.module.ts. No need for different
modules per feature.

Any components or pages in Figma are designed for mobile. When
developing, use a window width of about 375px.

*AppRootComponent*

The landing page should contain the header (with logo and title) and
also `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` to facilitate our pages which
will be created later. +
The component on its own should look similar to this:

image::../../.gitbook/assets/landingpage.svg[AppRootComponent]

The `AppRootComponent` has to be generated in client/app/root with
filename and selector `app-root-component` . For the styling use
https://material.angular.io/components/toolbar/overview[`mat-toolbar`]
for the header. Styling has to be alignes with the design in
https://www.figma.com/file/7G6VzJ3AKWFg7dJQ2AcLEd/Dapsi?node-id=3%3A0[Figma]

And with the
https://github.com/digita-ai/dapsi-docs/tree/f6a3ca41e6e9ee7a582f9ada93d810fa4811f81c/.gitbook/assets/landingpage.svg[screenshot]
above.

*AppStartLandingPageComponent*

This page should contain no more than a title, a brief description and a
button that brings you to the `AppStartLoginPageComponent`. +
The component on its own should look similar to this:

In the rootpage this will give the following :

Generate the `AppStartLandingPageComponent` under `client/app/pages`
with filename and selector : `app-start-landing-page`. The routing
should be configured in `app.module.ts`, paths `''` and `'**'` should
load the `AppStartLandingPageComponent`. Make sure that pathMatch: full
is set and set the routing with
`component: AppStartLandingPageComponent`. Make sure you add
https://github.com/ngx-translate/core[ngx-translate] for all the labels
(title and description in this case). Add
`import { TranslateModule, TranslateLoader } from '@ngx-translate/core';`
to the app module and follow the installation instructions on the github
page above.

The Json file for translations will be called : `nl_BE.json` and is
located under `src/translations/nl_BE.json`. The keys for title and
description are `appStartLandingPage.title` and
`appStartLandingPage.description`.

Style the component with a simple `<h1>` tag for the title and a `<p>`
tag for the description. Use
https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview[`mat-button`] for
the login button. When this button is clicked, the app should navigate
to `/login`. The angular router has to be used. Align styling with
https://www.figma.com/file/7G6VzJ3AKWFg7dJQ2AcLEd/Dapsi?node-id=3%3A0[Figma].
See

above.

Unwanted material styling can be overwritten by using the correct
selector: use `.mat-flat-button` to overwrite the buttonâ€™s original
styling.
